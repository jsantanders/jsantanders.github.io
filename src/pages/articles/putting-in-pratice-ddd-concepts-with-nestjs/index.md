This morning when I start to think about this post, I was wondering about asking the audience things that they want to view in a demo project focused on Domain-Driven Design, but my blog is too new and has few visitors. I want to have a dynamic blog, until that, a thing that I can do and maybe could help you (occasional reader) is creating a list of the things that I want to achieve with this project.

## Things that I want to achieve with this project

- Follow Domain Drive Design principles. Talks with domain experts, develop a ubiquitus language, delimitate bounded context, and so on.
- Implement referent patterns for backend services, such like CQRS, Event Sourcing.
- Build a monolith, but modular.
- Apply good practices like KISS, SOLID and develop under TDD.

## Technologies that I want to use

- Typescript + Nestjs + Docker. I think it is going to be nice, I was wondering to use .NET but I think there are a lot of good examples built right now.
- CosmosDB + Mongo API.
- Typescript + React + Next.
- Azure as cloud infrastructure.

## Domain

This is an application for project management under the Agile methodology. I will be posting regularly here, but also you can check advances in this [repository](https://github.com/jsantanders/modular-monolith-nestjs).
